### Core information

#### Revised front page

The Dependable Systems Group (DSG) is a diverse collection of
colleagues working in a range of areas covering foundations, 
systems and applications of both.

The research aims and objectives of the Dependable Systems Group are
to improve the reliability and predictability of computer systems
through the development and application of rigorous design,
implementation and verification techniques. More broadly, Dependable
Systems research is considered as spanning the following three layers:

- Foundations: logic; discrete mathematics; computability; algorithmic analysis and complexity.  
- Technologies: specification oriented prototyping; performance modeling; simulation;
   formal verification; empirical verification and validation; automated reasoning; refinement and synthesis.  
- Applications: artificial intelligence; safety critical systems; secure systems; fault tolerant systems;
   performance optimisation; multi process/processor systems; hybrid/embedded systems; predictable systems.  

We are part of the [Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance
(SICSA)](https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/), which pools together the top computing departments in
Scotland and also provides an enriched research environment for all
staff and students.

We are part of the Scottish Programming Languages Institute (SPLI).

We have strong links to other Scottish universities and these are
listed on the DSG pages in the section on Collaborators.

The seminars of the DSG group are merged with those of the LAIV group and a [seminar schedule is available here](https://laiv.uk/laiv-seminars/).

#### Grouped topics

Topics:
- __artificial intelligence__: verification, high-performance machine learning
- __functional programming__: foundations ((dependent) type systems, static analysis, semantics, lambda calculus), implementation (parallel and in-hardware implementations), applications (symbolic computation)
- __automated reasoning__: formal methods, interactive theorem proving, metatheory of programming languages 
- __networking__: mobile adhoc networks (MANETs), software-defined networking (SDN)

#### SAMPLE Activity: Parallel Functional Programming


Parallel Functional Programming

We aim to realise productivity and reliability benefits by developing
high-level, parallel and distributed coordination abstractions and
language extensions, which must be supported by effective
implementations, have simple semantics and be amenable to
reasoning. We are:

. designing and evaluating new high-level coordination models in order to exploit emerging architectures, and new models of computation
. developing analyses of high-level parallel and distributed languages to better support coordination
. encouraging adoption of new high-level coordination models via long term relationships with user communities, e.g. GAP, Maplesoft, Kant, Mupad

### OLD NOTES and DRAFTS

#### Priorities for changes

1. Front page text and layout (see above)
2. Update and clean up list of people; cross-link to tab on collaborators
3. Move activities to "Past Activities" (for now)
4. Collect entries for new "Activities" list, using the "Parallel Functional Programming" activity as template/sample

#### James' text

We are a diverse collection of colleagues working in the related areas
of programing language theory and practice, formal methods and formal
modelling, verification and model checking, interactive theorem
proving [insert more as appropriate], united by the aim of developing
sound, robust methods for the design and implementation of software
systems.

#### Page structure:

_Tabs:_ People | Project | Publications | Seminars | Collaborators 

Text for collaborators should also cover SICSA and SPLI / SPLV with links.

#### Changes Front page:

Taken out some sub-items:
- probability and statistics;  -> _something related to ML instead?_
- transformation; -> _droped_
- disaster analysis and recovery; -> _droped; we don't rely have a track record there (?)_

#### old text

The research aims and objectives of the Dependable Systems Group are
to improve the reliability and predictability of computer systems
through the development and application of rigorous design,
implementation and verification techniques. More broadly, Dependable
Systems research is considered as spanning the following three layers:

- Foundations: discrete mathematics; logic; computability; probability
   and statistics; algorithmic analysis and complexity.  
- Technologies: specification oriented prototyping; performance modeling; simulation;
   formal verification; empirical verification and validation; automated
   reasoning; transformation; refinement and synthesis.  
- Applications:safety critical system; secure systems; fault tolerant systems;
   disaster analysis and recovery; performance optimisation; multi
   process/processor systems; hybrid/embedded systems; predictable
   systems.  

Our current strengths lie mainly within Foundations – models
and formalisms for languages and systems – and within Technologies –
functional programming, performance modelling, parallel prototyping,
automated reasoning and formal verification.

We are part of the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance
(SICSA), which pools together the top computing departments in
Scotland and also provides an enriched research environment for all
staff and students.

We have strong links to other Scottish universities, in particular
with the Glasgow Parallelism Group at the University of Glasgow on
high-level languages and systems for parallel computation.
