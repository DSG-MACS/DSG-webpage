Dependable Systems Group at Heriot-Watt
{{< /lead >}} -->

The Dependable Systems Group (DSG) is a diverse collection of
colleagues working in a range of areas covering foundations, 
systems and applications of both.

The research aims and objectives of the Dependable Systems Group are
to improve the reliability and predictability of computer systems
through the development and application of rigorous design,
implementation and verification techniques. More broadly, Dependable
Systems research is considered as spanning the following three layers:

- #### Foundations: 
   logic; discrete mathematics; computability; algorithmic analysis and complexity.  
- #### Technologies: 
   specification oriented prototyping; performance modeling; simulation;
   formal verification; empirical verification and validation; automated reasoning; refinement and synthesis.  
- #### Applications: 
   artificial intelligence; safety critical system; secure systems; fault tolerant systems;
   performance optimisation; multi process/processor systems; hybrid/embedded systems; predictable systems.  

### [More information on the current research areas](/~dsg/public/researchareas)


We are part of the [Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance
(SICSA)](https://www.sicsa.ac.uk/), which pools together the top computing departments in
Scotland and also provides an enriched research environment for all
staff and students.

We are part of the emerging [Scottish Programming Languages Institute (SPLI)](https://scottish-pl-institute.github.io/).

We have strong links to other Scottish universities and these are
listed in the section on [Collaborators](collaborations).

The seminars of the DSG group are merged with those of the [LAIV group](http://laiv.uk/) and a [seminar schedule is available here](https://laiv.uk/laiv-seminars/).
