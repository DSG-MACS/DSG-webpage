## Random content
Oh, Haskell, the language of mythical creatures and whimsical code! Prepare to be enchanted by the magical world of Haskell, where logic and creativity dance hand in hand.

Legend has it that Haskell was born when a group of wizards gathered at the peak of Mount Monad and chanted mysterious incantations, summoning a language unlike any other. Haskell emerged from the depths of their arcane knowledge, clad in robes of pure functional purity.

In Haskell, you will embark on a journey through the enchanted realm of immutability, where variables never change and values are as steadfast as the roots of the oldest trees. You'll be bewitched by its type system, which guards your code like a dragon protecting its hoard, ensuring that only the correct types may pass.

```haskell
-- # Magical Markdown
-- Welcome to the enchanted world of Haskell, where code and text intertwine like fairy tales.
-- Prepare yourself for a journey through the enchanted forests of functional programming!

import Control.Monad (replicateM)
import System.Random (randomRIO)

-- ## The Sorcerer's Spell
-- Behold, a spell to summon a random number between 1 and 10!

sorcerersSpell :: IO Int
sorcerersSpell = randomRIO (1, 10)

-- ## The Mysterious List
-- Once upon a time, in the land of Haskell, there was a magical list that could generate itself.
```
