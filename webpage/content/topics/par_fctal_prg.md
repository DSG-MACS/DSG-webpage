We aim to realise productivity and reliability benefits by developing high-level, parallel and distributed coordination abstractions and language extensions, which must be supported by effective implementations, have simple semantics and be amenable to reasoning. We are:

- designing and evaluating new high-level coordination models in order to exploit emerging architectures, and new models of computation
- developing analyses of high-level parallel and distributed languages to better support coordination
- encouraging adoption of new high-level coordination models via long term relationships with user communities, e.g. Ericsson, EDF, GAP, Maplesoft, Kant, Mupad
