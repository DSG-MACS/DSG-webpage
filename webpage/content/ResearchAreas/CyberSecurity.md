The Cyber Security group at Heriot-Watt University brings together cyber security research and teaching activities taking place in the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University, both in our Edinburgh UK and Dubai UAE campuses. Heriot-Watt's Cyber security group is a partner in the UK Cyber Security & Privacy Seminar Series.


## Projects 
### [Secrious Project](https://secrious.github.io/) (EPSRC EP/T017511/1 2020-24):

Software development and deployment is now more widely accessible which raises cybersecurity concerns. The Secrious interdisciplinary project aims at engaging this wider audience, we called Code Citizens, to consider code security through the use and design of serious games.  The project developed methodologies and toolkits to empower non-experts to discuss and consider code cybersecurity. Among the outputs, we developed a deck of cybersecurity cards based on CyBOK to introduce key concepts of code security.

### [Citadel Programming Lab](https://citadel-programming-lab.gitlab.io/) (NCSC-RISCS 2017-18, CyBOK 2021-22)

This project was to develop an educational software security platform combining a serious game and coding exercises. The game includes references to the software security concepts at play in the coding exercises. The documentations and learning materials of the Citadel Programming Lab are linked with the CyBOK 1.1 Knowledge Base.
