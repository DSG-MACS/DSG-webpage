We aim to realise productivity and reliability benefits by developing
high-level, parallel and distributed coordination abstractions and
language extensions, which must be supported by effective
implementations, have simple semantics and be amenable to
reasoning. We are:

- designing and evaluating new high-level coordination models in order to exploit emerging architectures, and new, in particular functional, models of computation
- developing analyses of high-level parallel and distributed languages to better support coordination
- encouraging adoption of new high-level coordination models via long term relationships with user communities, e.g. 123Invest, Codethink, Codeplay, Well-Typed
