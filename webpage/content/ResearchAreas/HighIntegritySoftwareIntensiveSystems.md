## Projects

### Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Node in Governance and Regulation:
#### [UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Node in Governance and Regulation – ‘Better Governance by Design’ EPSRC grant EP/V026607/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/V026607/1)
Co-evolving regulation with the development of autonomous systems lies at the heart of the project, where trust is underpinned by evidence. The project brings together computer science and AI specialists, legal scholars, AI ethicists, as well as experts in science and technology studies and design ethnography.
