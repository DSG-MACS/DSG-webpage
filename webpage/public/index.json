Joint with John Power, University of Bath.\nA Brief Description # This research project arose from our studies of coalgebraic semantics for logic programming and SLD-resolution proposed in research papers on Coalgebraic Logic Programming (CoALP) cf. [Komendantskaya and Power, 2011] below. In the course of this project, CoALP helped us to discover a method of ``Structural Resolution\u0026quot; - a proof method for Horn Clause Logic that is hybrid between Term-rewriting and First-order resolution. This new kind of resolution allowed us to give a structural reformulation for proof-search algorithms in logic programming.\nTowards the second half of the project, we have been working on type-theoretic semantics of logic programming and its applications to Type Class inference in Haskell; as well as refinements of categorical (coalgebraic) semantics of Horn Clause logic.\nSee also: # Workshop on Coalgebra, Horn Clause Logic Programming and Types, 28-29 November 2016, Edinburgh, UK.

And fear not the side effects, for they are banished to the dark corners of the monadic world, where only the chosen few dare to venture.\nIn this realm, functions are like spells, casting their magic on the data that flows through them. Pattern matching is your wand, allowing you to conjure elegant and concise code. And laziness, oh laziness, it is the hidden power that allows you to create infinite lists and compute only what you need, like a genie granting wishes without wasting an ounce of magic.\nBut do not be deceived, for mastering Haskell is no easy feat. It requires the wisdom of a sage and the patience of a saint. You will spend hours deciphering cryptic compiler error messages, wrestling with the monads, and taming the wild beasts of type inference. But fear not, for with persistence and dedication, you shall prevail.\nSo, if you dare to enter the realm of Haskell, be prepared to be enchanted by its elegance and haunted by its challenges.

We can be broadly classified by our holistic perspective of automated reasoning. Central to this theme is the interplay between representation and reasoning. Discovering the right representation can often dramatically simplify the reasoning required in solving a problem. Conversely, meta-level reasoning, and in particular proof-failure analysis, can often provide guidance in evolving the right representation. The Platform Grant enables us to maintain and strengthen the momentum that has been build up around this theme - both in terms of basic research as well as applications: The former covers a spectrum of topics, including: cognitive aspects of theory formulation and reformulation; mathematical discovery and automatic theorem generation; ontology creation, repair and evolution; proof procedures; proof planning; AI problem reformulation; quantum computation; computational creativity; visualisation of reasoning processes. The latter covers wide ranging applications such as: software verification; formal modeling of software intensive systems; graphics design; games design; disaster recovery planning. Our work is a unique blend of the techniques of artificial intelligence and theoretical computer science - we also believe we are unique in our holistic perspective of automated reasoning and mathematical discovery Further details can be obtained from Andrew Ireland, Dependable Systems Group, School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, EH14 4AS, UK [ a.ireland@hw.ac.uk, +44 (0)131 451 3409 ]\nEPSRC webpage for Platform Grant EP/J001058\n","date":"January 1, 1","permalink":"/projects/project1/","section":"Projects","summary":"Platform Grant Investigators # Andrew Ireland (Heriot-Watt University) [ Principal Investigator ] David Aspinall (University of Edinburgh) Alan Bundy (University of Edinburgh) Alan Smaill (University of Edinburgh) Jacques Fleuriot (University of Edinburgh) Paul Jackson (University of Edinburgh) Fiona McNeill (Heriot-Watt University) Greg Michaelson (Heriot-Watt University) Jeremy Gow (Goldsmiths College) Gudmund Grov (Heriot-Watt University) Simon Colton (Goldsmiths College) Overview # This Platform Grant supports essential infrastructure and exploratory activities for a portfolio of projects that focus on the automation of mathematical reasoning processes - including their analysis, development and interaction.","title":"The Integration and Interaction of Multiple Mathematical Reasoning Processes."}]
